# 🏥 Insurance Charges Analysis & Prediction

## 🧠 Project Overview
This repository presents a complete **end-to-end data science project** focused on predicting individual **medical insurance charges** based on demographic and lifestyle factors.  

The workflow includes:
- 🧹 **Data cleaning** and **outlier detection** using Isolation Forest  
- 📊 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to uncover key relationships between features  
- ⚙️ **Feature engineering** and **encoding** of categorical variables  
- 🤖 **Model development** using Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting  
- 🎯 **Hyperparameter tuning** with GridSearchCV to optimize model accuracy  
- 🔍 **Model interpretation** with Feature Importance and **SHAP values**  
- ✅ **Cross-validation** to validate model generalization and stability  

The final tuned **Gradient Boosting model** achieved:
- **MAE:** ≈ 2388  
- **RMSE:** ≈ 4910  
- **R²:** ≈ 0.85  

This repository demonstrates the **entire machine learning pipeline** — from raw data exploration to a fully interpretable and production-ready predictive model.
